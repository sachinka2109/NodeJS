The word asynchronous means not occurring at the same time. What does it mean in the context of JavaScript?

Typically, executing things in sequence works well. But you may sometimes need to fetch data from the server or execute a function with a delay, something you do not anticipate occurring NOW. So, you want the code to execute asynchronously.

In these circumstances, you may not want the JavaScript engine to halt the execution of the other sequential code. So, the JavaScript engine needs to manage things a bit more efficiently in this case.

We can classify most asynchronous JavaScript operations with two primary triggers:

    Browser API/Web API events or functions. These include methods like setTimeout, or event handlers like click, mouse over, scroll, and many more.
    Promises. A unique JavaScript object that allows us to perform asynchronous operations.

JavaScript maintains a queue of callback functions. It is called a callback queue or task queue. A queue data structure is First-In-First-Out(FIFO).
