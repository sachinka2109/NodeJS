Promises :

A promise is an object in JavaScript that will produce a value sometime in the future. This usually applies to asynchronous operations.


The states of promises in JavaScript

A promise has three states:

    pending: the promise is still in the works
    fulfilled: the promise resolves successfully and returns a value
    rejected: the promise fails with an error

The fulfilled and rejected states have one thing in common: whether a promise is fulfilled or rejected, the promise is settled. So a settled state could either be a fulfilled or a rejected promise.


Async/Await : 

It forces the code to run in a synchronous manner while it returns a promise that will be fulfilled or rejected
We use the try and catch blocks to make sure we get what we expect
